1.Importing Dataset: Importing the dataset is a crucial first step. Kaggle is a great platform for accessing diverse datasets. Did you use any specific dataset related to image recognition.
2.Preprocessing: Preprocessing ensures that your data is clean and ready for training. Common preprocessing steps include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, handling missing data, and augmenting the dataset.
3.Training Image Preprocessing: This step involves preparing the images for training. Techniques like data augmentation (flipping, rotation, zooming) can improve model generalization.
4.Building the Model:
5.Convolutional Layers: Convolutional layers are essential for capturing spatial patterns in images.
6.Saving the Model in JSON Format: Saving the model allows you to reuse it without retraining. JSON format is commonly used for model serialization.
7.Calculating Accuracy: Evaluating model accuracy is crucial.
8.Visualizing Model Performance: Visualizing accuracy curves, loss curves, and confusion matrices helps understand model behavior. Matplotlib or Seaborn are handy for creating visualizations.
9.Predicting on a Single Image: Exciting! Predicting on a single image demonstrates how well your model generalizes.
